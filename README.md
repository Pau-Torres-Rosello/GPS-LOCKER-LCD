# GPS-LOCKER-LCD
This project is designed for the 
location of our position to save lives.
We have used ARDUINO IDE version 1.8.19 and the ESP32 Board Boards. 
To make it easier use the ESP32 DevModule board. Works with any ESP32


I also created a design in TinckerCad, a 3d object modeling program, and made the cover and the box to size.

The files are .STL for 3D printer and the CUDA program is used.
The box design is free for everyone.
